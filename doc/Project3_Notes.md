### 
### Be sure to address
- Value added by features  
- Value added by models  
**Note**: Make sure that you are combining different feature sets and classifiers, and also the comparisons make sense (So that you know what works)

### Organizing the GitHub folders
#### train.r
- Baseline
- Yours

#### test.r  
- folder of input feature objects
- input "model" object from train.r
- output predicted labels  
  
## Evaluation
- new set of 2000 images
- each team will have 30 minutes to process them into features chosen
- submit processed features as a folder of feature objects file. featured shoule be readable by train.r test.r.
- Eval on eval.r
- 40% in presentation (methodology; interpretability; presentation)
- 40% in new images (train error vs test; stability;consistancy)
- peer 20%

## Submit
- train.r & test.r , work out 2000 individual files of features and two r file (r files before class) and do not need to come up with predictions. TA wil do it...
